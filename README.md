Thanks to [kyaco](https://github.com/kyaco/WynnTextReplacer)

## About

This program reconstructs [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/) text into a translatable form.
<br>
Each Wynncraft text object is used to generate a translation map, and recorded in resourcepack's language file.

Most features are WIP.
